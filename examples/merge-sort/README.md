Experiments with mergesort
==========================

Run the MergeSortTest class to run and test merge sort.

*test1.sh tries various cutoff values for insertion sort to see which one is the best.

*test2.sh compares the sentinel version of merge versus the non-sentinel version.

*test3.sh runs mergesort with the proper cutoff and sentinels to see its performance over a range of input sizes.
