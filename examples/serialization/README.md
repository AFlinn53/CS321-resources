#Simple example of serialization and deserialization 


## SaveList.java, LoadList.java
The SaveList.java example shows how to use the built-in serialization in Java to store a list in a binary disk file and the LoadList.java example shows how to restore the list from the serialized data. Note that serialization stores objects in a sequential manner in the file.
